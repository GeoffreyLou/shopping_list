# shopping_list
Project done during my Python training. Creation of a shopping list with recording in a JSON file.

The script checks for the existence of a shopping_list.json file, if it doesn't exist then it will create it with a list inside to work on.

The script also checks that the list is present if the file already exists. 

Finally, the user will be prompted to choose if he wants to add an item, remove one, display the list or empty it of its content.

When the user wants to quit the program, the new list is saved. Thus, if the program is started again, the previously saved list will be available.
